# Network Programming Practices
This is a collection of my network programming practices. I started to
do this because, as a long time web designer/developer, I want to
understand how the Internet works internally.

The code is quick and dirty as the sole purpose of the whole thing is to
learn the network. If needed, you can do whatever you want with the code.
